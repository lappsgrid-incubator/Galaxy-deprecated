Highlights
===========================================================

**Interactive Tours**
  The interactive tours framework allows developers and deployers to build
  interactive tutorials for users superimposed on the actual Galaxy web front
  end. Unlike video tutorials, these will not become stale and are truly 
  interactive (allowing users to actually navigate and interact with Galaxy).
  Galaxy 16.01 ships with two example tours and new ones can easily be added by
  creating a small YAML file describing the tour. Try the `Galaxy UI tour
  <https://usegalaxy.org/?tour_id=core.galaxy_ui>`__  on Main.

**Wheels**
  Galaxy's Python dependencies have traditionally been distributed as eggs_ using
  custom dependency management code to enable Galaxy to distribute binary 
  dependencies (enabling quick downloads and minimal system requirements). With 
  this release all of that infrastructure has been replaced with a modern Python
  infrastructure based on pip_ and wheels_.
  Work done as part of this to enable binary dependencies on Linux has been 
  included with the recently released pip_ 8.

  Detailed documentation on these changes and their impact under a variety of
  Galaxy deployment scenarios can be found in the :ref:`framework-dependencies`
  section of the Admin documentation.

**Nested Workflows**
  Workflows may now run other workflows as a single abstract step in the parent
  workflow. This allows for reusing or subworkflows in your analyses.
